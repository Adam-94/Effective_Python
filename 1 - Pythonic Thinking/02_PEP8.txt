Python Enhancement Proposal #8, or otherwise known as PEP8,
is the style guide for how to format Python code. 

The full guide on how to use the PEP8 standard is available at
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

Thing to Remember

* Always follow PEP8 style when writing Python code.
* Sharing a common style with the larger Python community facilitates collaboration with others. 
* Using a consistent style makes it easiser to modify you on code later.
